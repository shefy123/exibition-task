          <h3>Zein Ahmed
          </h3>
          <p>Zein Ahmed’s journey with ethical design began nearly three decades ago in Lahore. This was the early 1990s, and it
            marked the beginning of her love for handloom textiles. In 1998 Zein shifted to New York where she became part of
            the slow fashion movement, setting up her own clothing label, Guru. Her lifestyle range of linen tunics and dresses
            were borne out of that first impulse—classic silhouettes, crafted with urban flair, and based on social as well as
            environmentally conscious production modes. Zein works with a bold heart (and phenomenal speed). Making Life Matter,
            her new ensemble line, draws upon a year-long passion project with Sindh-based artisans. She has spent about 8 months
            in research, before launching production in January this year. The outcome—a limited edition show of 4, 8, and 12-panel
            kurtas, as well as short tunics, made with pure, breathable fabric. Inspired by the practice of ‘truest form,’ Zein
            engaged traditional, master craftsmen from the region—weaving ustad, Wazir Ali, and ajrak ustad, M. Riaz—in order
            to develop her base textiles. These were then crafted with embroidery by gifted Sukker-based artisans. ‘The textiles
            are so happy because of this!—these craftswomen claim what they are working on. 99%, their own ideas.’ Zein’s own
            guidance has been in terms of fabric quality, input on colour palette, minor feedback on works. Her guidance comes
            in fact as a shift in view. Encouraging ownership of freeform embroidery work and claim to fair wage practice—these
            values are perhaps her real lines of support. As a financial model, Zein made 50% payment in advance and 50% upon
            completion of works. With direct imbursement to individual makers, middle person access (and potential of pilferage)
            was removed. Craftswomen were paid well above standard market wages. And in total, 150 artisans were employed for
            the project term. Good design is then not about the surface of a garment alone. For this designer-entrepreneur, it
            is about a purity of practice from the ground up. Design, for Zein, resonates all stages of production and artisanal
            making. There’s something invisible here, in a tunic’s intimate feel. A transparent joy in adornment. Ethical excellence.
            - *Tankas or embroidery stitches include: hurmich, makri tanka, bharti tanka, kachi sui tanka, kundi, mirror work,
            and balochi tanka. *Block-print ustad M. Soomro, from Bhit Shah, worked with customised inks and blocks for the blockprint
            line.</p>
